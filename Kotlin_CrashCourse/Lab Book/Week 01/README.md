### README: Week 1 - Introduction to Kotlin and Setting Up the Environment
#### **Overview:**
Week 1 serves as an introduction to Kotlin as a programming language. During this week, students learn about the significance of Kotlin, how to set up their development environment, and how to write basic Kotlin programs. The focus is on understanding Kotlin's syntax, particularly variables and data types.

#### **Lab Exercises:**

1. **Setting up the Environment**
    - Install and set up the Kotlin development environment using IntelliJ IDEA.
    
2. **Hello World**
    - Write and execute the classic "Hello, Kotlin!" program to ensure the environment is correctly set up.

3. **Using Variables**
    - Declare and utilize variables in Kotlin. Understand the difference between `val` and `var`.

#### **Post-Lab Questions & Answers:**

1. **Question:** What is the difference between `val` and `var` in Kotlin?
    - **Answer:** In Kotlin, `val` is used to declare a read-only (immutable) variable, which means its value cannot be changed once assigned. On the other hand, `var` is used to declare a mutable variable, whose value can be changed later in the program.

2. **Question:** How do you print a variable's value within a string in Kotlin?
    - **Answer:** In Kotlin, you can print a variable's value within a string using string interpolation. You can include the variable directly in a string by prefixing it with the `$` symbol. For example, if you have a variable `name` with the value "Jane", you can print it within a string as `println("My name is $name.")`.

3. **Question:** Describe the steps to run a Kotlin program in IntelliJ IDEA.
    - **Answer:** 
        1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and navigate to the Kotlin file you wish to run.
        2. Save the file after making any necessary edits.
        3. Click on the green triangle icon next to the `fun main()` line. Alternatively, right-click anywhere within the file and select `Run '[FileName]Kt'`.
        4. Observe the output in the console pane at the bottom of the IDE.
